# Mathlib Initiative Task List

This repository exists to gather a list of tasks which the Mathlib Initiative can consider undertaking.

Tasks are represented using GitHub issues. Members of the Lean / Mathlib community are encouraged to add comments or reactions to open issues, as well as to open new issues as appropriate. The Mathlib Initiative will close issues which it feels are not within scope. For now scope is not precisely defined but good tasks will align with items from [our roadmap](https://mathlib-initiative.org/roadmap/). Examples of good tasks might be:
 * A request for a new tactic
 * A request for a new linter
 * A request to pay down a certain type of Mathlib's technical debt
 * A request for tooling to assist development in downstream repositories
 * A detailed suggestion for how to improve some aspect of our documentation

Behind the scenes, the Mathlib Initiative will use this task list as an input into how it allocates resources and prioritises tasks. We hope and expect to accumulate a long list with far more good ideas than we have resources to implement.
